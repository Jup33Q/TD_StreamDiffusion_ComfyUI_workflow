# TD_StreamDiffusion_ComfyUI_workflow
This is a Comfyui friendly sample workflow connects TD and StreamDiffusion, totally opensourse, no need for 5 USD monthly subscribe

## How it works
#### First thing first, it all thanks to JISEN and Jesenzhang for their powerful tools used for connection between td and comfyui and stream diffusion!
##### Jisen's comfyui-TD plugins:https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1RxUyYyEeU/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=86ac50adfb97fa81fefdc85ec3eee777
##### and Jesen's comfyui-stream diffusion: https://github.com/jesenzhang/ComfyUI_StreamDiffusion

#### All I did is just mix those up 
basicly I just slightly change the sample workflow from Jesen

to this (note that the load image(base 64) and websocket must be the one in external_tooling installed following Jisen's tutorial )
